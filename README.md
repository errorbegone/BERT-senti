# Multilingual Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis on multilingual text data. BERT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model developed by Google.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we leverage the power of BERT to perform sentiment analysis on text data in multiple languages.

## Features

- Utilizes the `google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased` pre-trained model.
- Supports text data in various languages.
- Provides scripts for training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multilingual-sentiment-analysis.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your dataset:

   - Ensure your dataset is formatted as CSV files, with columns for reviews/text and corresponding sentiment labels.
   - Place the CSV files in the `dataset` directory.

4. Configure your settings:

   - Adjust the parameters in the `config.py` file to suit your requirements, such as batch sizes, epochs, model paths, etc.

5. Train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

6. Evaluate the model:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```
